#Overview
This project was completed for Udacity's Front End Nanodegree Program. The goal of the project was to complete the creation of a classic arcade game by adding to the javascript and images that were already provided. 


#Running the game
Download the code by selecting 'Download ZIP'. Then simply open the frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game folder, right click on index.html, and open in the browser of your choice.


#About the game
The game is set in a world made up of a grassy section, a stone section, and a water section. The enemies are bugs who patrol the stone section, which divides the grassy section from the water section. The player controls a character and tries to safely cross the stone section to reach the water, without hitting any bugs. 

The goal of the game is to gain as many points as possible in one round. A point is gained by reaching the water, and points are also gained by collecting gems along the way. A round ends when the player hits into a bug. 

There is no end to the game. You can play for hours if you want, trying to beat your last high score.


#Rules of the game
The player must reach the water without hitting into a bug. If the player is successful they will gain one point. If they hit a bug the round ends. The player is then moved back to the beginning position and the player's current score is compared to the high score. If it exceeded the high score it becomes the new high score. The current score is reset to zero and a new round starts.

Points can also be gained by hitting into gems that appear on the stone area. The blue gems are worth 1 point and the orange gems are worth 2 points. If the player hits into a gem, the score is increased and the gem is moved to a new random location. The players position is not changed.
